** TODO Log file design [0/3]                                    :python:js:

Consider the tasks you have to perform with log files.

For examplee, If you need to look at a sequence of operations 
during some session then it makes sense to have one global log 
file since merging information from many will be time consuming.

- [ ] Both?
